The goal of AFDapp is to use AFD open data to make a shiny app.  
This project shows that I have a good level in R.  
In this project I've used **Golem** to create a production ready project.  
I've also used :

  - **dplyr** for data manipulation
  - **reactable** to display beautiful and interactive table
  - **highcharter** and **echarts4r** to display awesome plot
  - **leaflet** to display map
  - and **shinymanager** to manage the access to the app


## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ngsanogo/AFDapp")
```

## usage

Once the package is installed, you can launch it with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
AFDapp::run_app()
```
